Two technologies are of particular interest, in that they show the impact [cloud computing](http://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/understand-the-cloud-spectrum/) is having on the data management discipline. [Hadoop](http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/hadoop/) distributions are deemed to be obsolete before reaching the Plateau of Productivity because the complexity and questionable usefulness of the entire Hadoop stack is causing many organizations to reconsider its role in their information infrastructure. Instead, organizations are looking at increasingly competitive and convenient cloud-based options with on-demand pricing and fit-for-purpose data processing options. 

As part of the same cloud-led trend, [SQL](http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/sql-structured-query-language/) interfaces to cloud object stores have appeared at the Innovation Trigger stage. "We expect these interfaces to represent the future of cloud database [Platform as a Service (Paas)](http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/platform-as-a-service-paas/) and reach the Plateau within two to five years because they are the focus of most cloud vendors and products in this space," said Mr. Feinberg. "They enable organizations to interact with data stored in the cloud, using a familiar SQL syntax. Object stores are well suited to storing large volumes of multistructured data, typical of data lakes."

Of the 35 other technologies highlighted on the 2017 Hype Cycle for Data Management, four are judged to be transformational in nature. Two — event stream processing (ESP) and operational in-memory [database management system](http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/dbms-database-management-system/) (IMDBMS) — are expected to reach the Plateau of Productivity within two to five years, while both [blockchain](http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/blockchain/) and distributed ledgers are expected to take five to 10 years.

**Event Stream Processing**

ESP is one of the key enablers of digital business, [algorithmic business](http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/algorithmic-business/) and intelligent business operations. ESP technology, including distributed stream computing platforms (DSCPs) and event processing platforms (EPPs), is maturing rapidly. Stream analytics provided by ESP software improves the quality of decision-making by presenting information that could otherwise be overlooked.

**Operational In-Memory DBMS**

Operational In-Memory database management systems (IMDBMS) technology is maturing and growing in acceptance, although the infrastructure required to support it remains relatively expensive. Another inhibitor to the growth of operational IMDBMS technology is the need for persistence models that support the high levels of availability required to meet transaction [SLAs](http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/sla-service-level-agreement/). Nevertheless, operational IMDBMSs for transactions have the potential to make a tremendous impact on business value by speeding up data transactions 100 to 1,000 times.

**Blockchain**

Public distributed ledgers, including blockchain, continue to have high visibility, although organizations remain cautious about the future of public (permission-less) distributed ledger concepts due to scalability, risk and governance issues. Most business use cases have yet to be proven and extreme price volatility in bitcoin persists. Presupposing the technical and business challenges of distributed ledgers can be overcome; in the short term, organizations are most likely to use distributed ledger for operational efficiency gains via the use of shared information and infrastructure. Longer term, Gartner expects a complete reformation of whole industries and commercial activity as the programmable economy develops and ledgers contribute to the monetization of new ecosystems.

**Distributed Ledgers**

The requirements for more standards and enterprise-scale capabilities are evolving slowly, but distributed ledgers are still not adoptable in a mission-critical at-scale context. Their value propositions, compared with existing technology, are also not clearly established, making the widespread acceptance of the technology problematic. Private distributed ledger concepts are gaining traction, because they hold the promise to transform industry operating models and overcome some of the issues of scalability, risk management and governance that plague public ledgers. As with blockchain, however, many business use cases are unproven at this time.

**Innovation Triggers in 2018**

**DataOps** is a collaborative data management practice focused on improving the communication, integration and automation of data flows between data managers and consumers across an organization. Much like DevOps, DataOps is not a rigid dogma, but a principles-based practice influencing how data can be provided and updated to meet the need of the organization’s data consumers.

“DataOps is a new practice without any standards or frameworks,” said [Nick Heudecker](https://www.gartner.com/analyst/45472), research vice president at Gartner. “Currently, a growing number of technology providers have started using the term when talking about their offerings and we are also seeing data and [analytics](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/enter-the-age-of-analytics/) teams asking about the concept. The hype is present and DataOps will quickly move up on the Hype Cycle.”

**Private cloud dbPaaS** offerings merge the isolation of private cloud database platforms with the self-service and scalability of the public cloud. They recently started to appear in vendors’ portfolios and provide a cloud experience in an on-premises data center. Gartner analysts said private cloud dbPaaS can play the role of a transition technology as organizations develop their long-term cloud strategy.

“Private cloud dbPaaS is an option for organizations that are unable or not ready to move to public cloud offerings, due to security, regulatory or other concerns,” said [Adam Ronthal](https://www.gartner.com/analyst/52420), research director at Gartner. “Often, these organizations use existing on-premises infrastructure for dbPaaS, which as a result will shorten mainstream business adoption.”

Rudimentary machine learning ML has been used in data management products since the 1970s. Today, with the increased availability of ML and [artificial intelligence](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-to-get-artificial-intelligence-right/) (AI) libraries, vendors use modern varieties of ML for many self-management operations within data management software. These solutions not only tune and optimize the use of the products themselves, but suggest new designs, schemes and queries.

“We placed **ML-enabled data management** in the pre-peak section of the Hype Cycle because many of the modern use cases are in infancy,” Mr. Feinberg explained. “However, the technology will move fast. Many of the products using ML in data management are today only available on cloud platforms and likely to be trained with massive amounts of data. The improvements resulting from these training sessions will spread to on-premises software and there will be a surge in ML-enabled data management adoption during the next few years.”
