Quick way to embed code with syntax highlighting in your web page document is to create a GitHub gist:

1. Login to GitHub
2. Click the *Your Gists* link from the profile dropdown at the top or navigate to [gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com/)
3. Complete the gist
4. Make sure you click *Create Public Gist* button
5. You can embed your gist. The code for this is available in the *Embed* textbox. It looks similar to:
   ```<script src="https://gist.github.com/<username>/<gistid>.js"></script>```
