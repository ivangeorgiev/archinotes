# Essential Cloud Infrastructure - Core Services

## About This Course

Hello and welcome. My name is Jason Baker with the Google Cloud platform, and this course is the Essential Cloud Infrastructure Core Services. 

In this course, we're going to jump into Identity Access Management or IAM. Here, we're going to cover things such as roles, groups, organizations, folders, and service accounts. It sounds exciting, doesn't it? Well actually it's quite important because this essentially designs a hierarchy of exactly how your security model is going to be laid out. 

Such an example, do you want to give access to an entire team of individuals or perhaps would you like to curate those roles and customize what individuals have access to what? 

Perhaps your large enterprise and you need to organize multiple individual groups under one core set of authority. Now, perhaps this authority doesn't necessarily want to have physical access to all the virtual machines, but they want to have control who individually has those centralized billing. 

Perhaps you even just want to automate everything. You don't want humans to have access to the account. So you might create service accounts which will allow your applications to have the same credentials or act on behalf of a human to do some kind of automated function. 

Now once security is in place, you have to determine where's your data going to go. We'll cover things like Google Cloud Storage. Now that sounds very simple, in fact it is, but there's a number of feature rich features that we're going to talk about. The first one is encryption, in many different countries encryption is a big concern. So, we have what we call customer supplied encryption keys. Things like lifecycle management. What happens if data is deleted or we want object versioning? So, what that allows us to do is essentially have any number of backups and then we can get into a lifecycle management which can determine as data gets older. Do we need to keep it around? Perhaps we might want to move it to a more affordable type of storage or delete it altogether for archive purposes. Object change notification. This is kind of a fun one not a lot of people think about. If you have billions and billions of files, what happens if something changes with your applications like to know about it? What if users uploaded 1000 pictures all at once, would you like to look for that or would you like to be told about that? Google Cloud Storage really encompasses a lot of fantastic features, that we're going to deep dive to really kind of make your applications function well. 

Now with that, we also have to worry about resource management. So this is going to include things like quotas. Anything you do in the cloud is going to cost money. So, you need to understand exactly what your effect will have on billing. So, this is why we establish quotas. So essentially you don't shoot yourself in the foot. We always like to say that, we'll give you the gun but you have to ask for the bullets, kind of a Google humor thing. But the other thing is labeling. Well if you have all of these different resources, how are you going to export your bill and understand that these resources went to a specific team? So then we'll talk about resource labeling as well. 

Then finally, resource monitoring. This is where we can allow you to monitor all your resources in the cloud. You can create automated response systems, customized dashboards, interactive logging, all of this is taken care of through an application we call Stackdriver. Stackdriver was built AWS. So, one of the benefits there is not only to get monitoring and logging and all sorts of other great features on Google, but you can also extend this to AWS as well.

## Module 1: Cloud IAM (Identity and Access Management)

### Learning Objectives

Recall that Global Google Identity is related to and visible in email addresses.

Explain that roles are used to administer user access in Cloud IAM.

Recall that Google Identify is administered outside of GCP in a Google-administered domain.

Identify that firewall rules can be used along with Cloud IAM to provide another layer of security and access control in GCP.

Implement access control for specific features or resources using Cloud IAM.



### Overview

Hello and welcome. I'm Philip Maier, a course developer with Google Cloud Platform, and this is module one, Cloud Identity and Access Management or IAM. 

Cloud IAM is a sophisticated system built on top of email like address names, drop type roles and granular permissions. If you're familiar with IAM from other implementations, look for the differences that Google has implemented to make IAM easier to administer and more secure. In this module, I will start by introducing Cloud IAM from a high-level perspective, then we will dive into each of the different components with cloud IAM, which are organizations, roles, members and service accounts.

I will also introduce some best practices to help you apply these concepts in your day to day work. Finally, you will get first-hand experience with Cloud IAM through our lab.



### Cloud Identity and Access Management

#### Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM)

So, what is Identity Access Management? 

![1542538244608](/copied/1542538244608.png)

It is a way of thinking who can do what, on which resource. The who can be a person, group or an application, the what refers to specific privileges or actions and the resources could be any GCP service. For example I could give you the privilege or role of compute engine viewer. This provides you read only access to get endless to compute engine resources without being able to read the data stored on them. C

loud IAM is composed of different objects as shown on the slide.

![1542538310022](/copied/1542538310022.png)

We are going to cover each of these in this module. 

However, to get a better understanding of where these fit in, let's look at the Cloud IAM resource hierarchy. 

![1542538361848](/copied/1542538361848.png)

GCP resources are organized hierarchically as shown in this tree structure. The organization node is the root node in this hierarchy, folders are the children of the organization, projects are the children of the folders, and the individual resources are the children of the projects. Each resource has exactly one parent. Cloud IAM allows you to set policies at all of these levels, where a policy contains a set of roles enrolled members. Let me go through each of the levels from top to bottom, as resources inherit policies from their parent. The organization resource represents your company. Cloud IAM roles granted at this level are inherited by all resources under the organization. The folder resource could represent your department. Cloud IAM roles granted at this level are inherited by all resources that the folder contains. Projects represent a trust boundary within your company. Services within the same project have a default level of trust. For example, the queue_a application shown here can access bucket A, as they are part of the same project, project bookshelf. 

The Cloud IAM **policy hierarchy always allows the same path** as the GCP research hierarchy. Meaning, if you change the research hierarchy, the policy hierarchy also changes. For example, moving a project into a different organization will update the project's Cloud IAM policy to inherit from the new organization's Cloud IAM policy. 

Another thing to point out is that **child policies cannot restrict access granted at the parent level**. For example, if I grant you the editor role for the bookshelf project, and I grant you the viewer role to the queue_a application, then you still have the editor role for that application. Therefore it is a best practice to follow the principle of **least privilege**. This principle applies to identities, roles and resources. Always select the smallest scope that's necessary to reduce your exposure to risk.

#### Organization

Let's learn more about the organization node. 

![1542538651993](/copied/1542538651993.png)

As I mentioned earlier the organization resource is the root node in the GCP resource hierarchy. This node has many roles, like the organization admin. The organization admin provides a user like Bob, access to administer all resources belonging to his organization, which is useful for auditing. There is also a project creator role which allows a user like Alice to create projects within her organization. 

I'm showing the project creator role here as it can also be applied at the organizational level, which would then be inherited by all projects within the organization. 

![1542538733226](/copied/1542538733226.png)

The organization itself is created by Google sales, which includes establishing the organization owners. G Suite Super Admins, which we'll talk more about later are the only organization owners. These organization owners can assign the organization admin role, that we just discussed through the G Suite Admin console which is a separate product. Organization administrators on the other hand, managed GCP from the Google cloud console. 

For security purposes, it's the best practice to always have **more than one organization owner**.

Let's talk more about folders as they can be seen as sub organizations within the organization.

![1542538819797](/copied/1542538819797.png)

Folders provide an additional grouping mechanism and isolation boundary between projects. Folders can be used to model different legal entities, departments, and teams within the company. For example, a first level of folders could be used to present the main departments in your organization, like department X and department Y. Because Folders can contain projects and other folders, each folder could the include other sub folders to represent different teams, like Team A and Team B. Each team folder could contain additional sub folders to represent different applications, like Product 1 and Product 2. Folders allow delegation of administration rights. So, for example, each head of a department can be granted full ownership of all GCP resources that belong to their departments.

Similarly, access to resources can be limited by folder. So, users in one department can only access and create GCP resources within that folder. 

Let's look at some other resource manager roles, while keeping in mind that policies are inherited top to bottom.

![1542538943537](/copied/1542538943537.png)

The organization node also has a viewer role that grants view access to all resources within an organization. The folder node has multiple roles that mimic the organizational roles, but are applied to resources within a folder. There is an admin role that provides full control over folders. A creator role, to browse the Hierarchy, and create folders, and viewer role to view folders and projects below a resource. Similarly for projects, there's a creator role that allows a user to create new products, making that user automatically the owner. There's also a project leader role that grants deletion privileges for projects.

I recommend exploring the documentation link and the nodes of these slides for a full list of resource manager roles.

I previously mentioned that a G Suite Super Admin works in G Suite.

![1542539063844](/copied/1542539063844.png)

Both G Suite and GCP are part of a single product line called, Google Cloud, but they are separate products. The G Suite Admin has two functions with respect to GCP. One, G Suite Super Admin can assign GCP organization owner to an account from within the G Suite Admin console. A GCP organization owner, can also create more organization owners by sending the role to an account within the GCP console. The G Suite Super Admin cannot assign any other GCP roles to accounts from the admin console. Second, the G Suite Super Admin creates users and groups, controls memberships of users in groups, and controls Google-hosted domains.

From an authorisation perspective, GCP uses Google's credentials system which is directly integrated into G Suite.

![1542539149267](/copied/1542539149267.png)

You can sync existing credentials using Google Cloud Directory Sync, and optionally implement single sign-on. I will talk more about both of these in the coming slides. Using Google's credentials system provides many built-in features, like session activity tracking, session management tools, security alerts, and even suspicious activity detection. 

![1542539210570](/copied/1542539210570.png)

With Google card directory sync or GCDS, the G Suite Admin can automatically add, modify, and delete users, groups, and non-employee contacts to synchronize the data G Suite domain with an LDAP directory server or MS Active Directory. The data in the LDAP directory server is **never modified or compromised**, making this a secure tool that helps keep track of users and groups. The G Suite Admin uses the GCDS Configuration Manager to customize synchronizations and **can perform test synchronizations** to find what works best for the organization and then schedule synchronizations to occur when needed. 

As I mentioned earlier, GCP provides single sign-on authentication.

![1542539315401](/copied/1542539315401.png)

If you have your own identity system, you can continue using your own system and processes with SSO configured. When user authentication is required, Google will redirect to your system. If the user is authenticated in your system, access to Google Cloud Platform is given. Otherwise the users prompted to sign in. This also allows you to revoke access to GCP. 

If your existing authentication system supports SAML2, then SSO configuration is as simple as 3 links and a certificate as shown in the screenshot.

![1542539376818](/copied/1542539376818.png)

Otherwise you can use a third party solution, like ping or octa.

Let's look at some best practices in regards to what we've covered so far.

![1542539454420](/copied/1542539454420.png)

We already talked about the principle of least privilege. Remember to always apply the minimal access level that is required to reduce your exposure to risk. Since managing permissions for individual users can be cumbersome and error prone, I recommend using groups. For example, you could create a SecOps group for your security operations team that has multiple roles. For example, the security admin role to manage firewalls, and the log viewer role for auditing. When new members join the team, you just add them to the group. Policies allow you to secure your resources. You also want to make sure you control how additional users gain access to resources through policies and group memberships. Without strict control over policy changes and group memberships, you may inadvertently allow new users, more permissions than they need, which also violence the principle of least privilege. Finally, I suggest auditing policy changes. The audit logs should record project level permissions changes, and additional levels that are being added. 

In regards to using groups, I recommend to let the G Suite Admin handle membership to secure roles.

![1542539567470](/copied/1542539567470.png)

That being said, for high risk areas, assign roles to individuals directly rather than using groups.



#### Roles

Let's talk more about roles, which define the can do what on which resource part of Cloud IAM.

![1542541296625](/copied/1542541296625.png)

There are three kinds of roles in Cloud IAM, primitive roles, curator roles, and custom roles. Primitive roles are the original roles that were available in the GCP console. These are the owner, editor, and the viewer roles. The owner has full administrative access. This includes the ability to add and remove members and delete projects. The editor role has modify in the read access. This allows a developer to deploy applications and modify or configure its resources. The viewer role has read-only access. All of these roles are concentric. That is, the owner role includes the permissions of the editor role and the editor role includes the permissions of the viewer role.

There is also a billing administrator role to manage billing and add or remove administrators. Each project can have multiple owners, editors, viewers, and billing administrators.

In addition to the primitive roles, Cloud IAM providing additional curated roles that give granular access to specific GCP resources and prevent unwanted access to other resources.

![1542541406307](/copied/1542541406307.png)

These roles are a *collection of permissions*. Most of the time, to do any meaningful operations, you need more than one permission. For example, in this slide, a group of users is granted the instant admin role on project A. This provides the user of that group all the compute engine permissions listed on the right. 

Grouping these permissions into a role makes them easier to manage.

![1542541509497](/copied/1542541509497.png)

Roles represent abstract functions and are customized to align with real jobs. The permissions themselves are classes and methods in the APIs. For example, compute instances start can be broken down into service, resource, and verb, meaning that this permission is used to start a stopped compute engine instance. These permissions usually align with the actions corresponding REST API. The third type of roles are custom roles. You can create a Cloud IAM role with one or more permissions, but these roles are in a Beta release as of this recording. 

So, overall, we have organization, folder, project, and product-specific roles. 

![1542541582050](/copied/1542541582050.png)

The product-specific roles are crafted for each resource, and you can learn more about them in their products-specific Cloud IAM documentation. Please keep in mind that some of these roles are in Beta, which will be indicated in the documentation. 

Let's dive deeper into project and product-specific roles.

![1542541641499](/copied/1542541641499.png)

Project roles mimic the primitive roles in that there is a viewer, editor, and owner role. All of these roles are again concentric. That is, the owner role include the permissions of the editor role and the editor role include the permissions of the viewer role. Besides the permissions listed here, a project owner can also invite others to become project owners.

![1542541698542](/copied/1542541698542.png)

Doing so is as simple as sending an email invitation from the GCP console and having the new project owner accept invitation as shown here. Such an email is only set for project owner roles and not for other roles like assigning organization ownership.

I already talked about product-specific roles.

![1542541755359](/copied/1542541755359.png)

Here are some examples like the Compute Engine Instance Admin that allows to create, modify, and delete virtual machine instances and disks.

![1542541792997](/copied/1542541792997.png)

Each product or service has several of these roles. I recommend to check out the Cloud IAM documentation to determine which of these roles you want to implement in your infrastructure.

#### Members

Let's talk more about members, which define the who part of who can do what on which resource.

![1542541961003](/copied/1542541961003.png)

There are different types of members. There are users, and there are service accounts. As I will cover service accounts later in this module, let's focus on users for now. Users can be Google accounts, G Suite domains, Google Groups, or Cloud Identity domains. A Google account represents a developer, and administrator, or any person who interacts with GCP. An email address that is associated with a Google account such as a gmail.com address, can be an identity. A G Suite domain, represents a virtual group of all the members in an organization. G Suite customers can associate their email accounts with an Internet domain name. When you do this, each email account takes the form of username At mydomain.com. You can specify an identity by using an Internet domain name that is associated with a G suite account. A Google Group is a named collection of Google account and service accounts. Every group has a unique email address that is associated with the group. Like groupname@mydomain.com. Google Groups are a convenient way to apply and access policy to a collection of users. You can grant and change access controls for a whole group at once, instead of granting or changing access controls one at a time for individual users or service accounts. You can also easily add members to and remove members from a google group instead of updating a cloud IM policy to add or remove users. Now, GCP does not create or manage users or groups. As I explained earlier, the G Suite Admin manages users and groups for an organization in a separate product from GCP. 

![1542542124215](/copied/1542542124215.png)

If you want to take advantage of using a Google account but are not interested in receiving mail, through Gmail, then you can still create an account without Gmail. For more information on this explore the link in the notes of the slides.

#### Service Accounts

As I mentioned earlier, another type of members is a service account. A service account is an account that belongs to your application, instead of to an individual end user. This provides an identity for carrying out server-to-server interactions in a project without supplying user credentials. For example, if you write an application that reads and writes files on cloud storage, it must first authenticate to either the Google Cloud Storage, XML API or JSON API. You can enable service accounts, and Grant read write access to the account on the instance, where you plan to run your application. Then, program the application to obtain credentials from the service account. Your application authenticate seamlessly to the API without embedding any secrets or credentials in your instance, image, or application code. Service accounts are identified by an email address like the example shown here. There are three types of service accounts; user creator or custom, built-in, and Google APIs service accounts. By default, all projects come with the built-in Compute Engine default service account. Apart from the default service account, all projects come with a Google Cloud platform API service account, identifiable by the email, project-number@cloudservices.gserviceaccount.com. This is a service account designed specifically to run internal Google processes on your behalf, and it is automatically granted the editor role on the project. Alternatively, you can also start an instance with a custom service account. Custom Service accounts provide more flexibility than the default service account, but they require a more management from you. You can create as many custom service accounts as you need, assign any arbitrary access scopes or Cloud IAM roles to them, and assign the service accounts to any virtual machine instance. Let's talk more about the default Compute Engine service account. As I mentioned, this account is automatically created per project. This account is identifiable by the email, projectnumber-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com, and it is automatically granted the editor role on the project. When you start a new instance using gcloud, the default service account is enabled on that instance. You can override this behavior by specifying another service account, or by disabling service accounts for the instance. Authorization is the process of determining what permissions and authenticated identity has on a set of specified resources. Scopes are used to determine, if an authenticated identity is authorized. In this example, applications A and B contain authenticated identities or service accounts. Let's assume that both applications want to use a Cloud Storage bucket. That each request access from the Google authorization server, and in return, they receive an access token. Application A receives an access token with read_only scope, so it can only read from the Cloud Storage bucket. Application B on the other hand, receives an access token with read_write scope, so it can read and modify data in the Cloud Storage bucket. These tokens can be short-term privileges. For example, if you want to provide read access to an eBook for 24 hours, then you can create a 24 hour access token that your application service would use. Scopes can be customized when you create an instance using the default service account, as shown in the screenshot on the right. These scopes can also be changed after an instance is created by stopping it. Scopes cannot be customized for user-created service accounts, but you can use Cloud IAM roles instead. The reason for this is, that access scopes are the legacy method for specifying permissions on your instance. Before the existence of IAM roles, access scopes where the only mechanism for granting permissions to the service accounts. Another distinction between service accounts is that default service accounts support primitive, project, and curated, or Cloud IAM roles. While user-created service accounts only use Cloud IAM roles. Now, roles for service accounts can also be assigned to groups or users. Let's look at the example shown on this slide. First, you create a service account that has the instance admin role, which has the permissions to create, modify, and delete virtual machine instances, and disks. Then, you treat this service account as the resource and decide who can use it by providing users or group with the service account user role. This allows those users to act as that services account to create, modify, and delete virtual machine instances, and disks. That being said, users who are service account users for a service account, can access all of these services for which the service account has access. Therefore, be cautious when granting the service account user role to a user or group. Here's another example. The VMs running component_one are granted Editor access to project_b using service account one. Whereas VMs running component_two are granted objectViewer access to bucket_one using an isolated service account two. This way, you can scope permissions for VMs without recreating VMs. Essentially, Cloud IAM less you slice a project into different microservices, each with access to different resources by creating service accounts to represent each one. You assign the service accounts to the VMs when they are created, and you don't have to ensure that credentials are being managed correctly as GCP manages security for you. You might ask, how our service accounts authenticated. While users require a username and password to authenticate, service accounts use keys. There are two types of service account keys; GCP-managed keys and user-managed keys. GCP-managed keys are used by Google Cloud platform services, such as App Engine and Compute Engine. These keys cannot be downloaded but Google will keep the keys and automatically rotate them daily. User-managed keys are created, downloadable, and managed by users. When you create a new key pair, you download the private key, which is not retained by Google. With external keys, you are responsible for security of the private key and other management operations, such as key rotation, which is illustrated on the slide.
